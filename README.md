early-stage-communication-framework
===================================

This was the early development of a communication framework, which allows programmers to easily create applications or services that incorporate a client-server model, p2p, or hybrids between the two. Work is not continued due to the fact that a lot of similar frameworks already exist (e.g. rabbitmq), and secure messaging apps have already been built as well.

Perhaps someone will benefit from what is done here (the wiki may contain some interesting information).
